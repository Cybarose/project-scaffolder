# proj

`proj` is a small command-line tool that initializes new projects from predefined templates.  
It is intended to provide a consistent project layout and reduce repetitive setup work, especially when starting multiple similar projects.

## Features

- Initialize projects from predefined templates (Ruby, Python, ESP32, generic)
- Create directory structures and basic files (such as README and .gitignore)
- Optional Git repository initialization
- Simple, composable design and clear code structure

## Installation (local development)

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-namespace/proj.git
cd proj
bundle install
